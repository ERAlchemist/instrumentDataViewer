Configuration Notes:

On the computer with the ChemWell software installed, the software installation folder (e.g. 'C:\Futura') must be shared to be accessible on the network.
The correct path to the archive files needs to be in the paths.js file. 
The path should have the following format:

   	\\serverName\share\pathToArchives

  serverName is the computer name or the IP address 
  share is the name of the shared folder
  pathToArchives is the relative path from the share folder to the folder containing the archive files (.mdb)
