Configuration Notes:

On the computer with the Futura software installed, the software installation folder (e.g. 'C:\Futura') must be shared to be accessible on the network.
The correct path to the database file needs to be in the paths.js file. 
The path should have the following format:

   	\\serverName\share\pathToDBfile

  serverName is the computer name or the IP address 
  share is the name of the shared folder
  pathToDBfile is the relative path from the share folder to the database file (.db)
